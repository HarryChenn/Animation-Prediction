# Animation-Prediction-Model

# Research Question
Our main objective is to identify the factors that contribute to the difference in the popularity of different animations. Popularity is a perfect indicator to measure an anime's success. There are multiple factors that affect anime's popularity. The production studio, the genre, and previously published reviews, for instance, could all have an effect. 

# Data filtering/Cleaning
As we are not creating a original dataset initially, the existing dataset has already been preprocessed, cleaned, and organized. The dataset, created by Marlesson Santana from Kaggle.com, was categorized into three files including the files of the review, profile, and anime. As shown above, the anime.csv contains lists including uid(user ID), titles, correspond synopsis, genre, aired(first broadcast period), episodes, members, popularity(popularity ranking), score, and finally ranked(a ranking according to score). As a result, there is no method needed to clean the data.
